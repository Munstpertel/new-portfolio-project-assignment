                        <hr /><p>Web apps or online apps can be a faster, cheaper, more efficient way of deploying software in your business.  Rather than buying a software license, having to install it on your servers or local computers, keeping up with updates — all of which can be expensive and take time — you can simply go online and sign up for an account.  In a few minutes you are using the software.  And typically you pay a monthly fee, meaning that you don’t have to pay license fee up front.

                        <h2>SUNFLOWER</h2>
                        <hr /><p>No flower can lift someone’s spirits quite like sunflowers. They are bright and cheery, and as warm and inviting as the sweet summer sun. With brilliant yellow petals, also known as “rays,” sunflowers have an unmistakable sun-like appearance that has made them a crowd favorite, especially in the summer months. Sunflowers come in a number of varieties—ranging from small to very large, from having yellow petals to red. However, there is more to sunflowers than meets the eye. While they are stunningly beautiful, they also are rich in history and meaning.</p>

                        <h2>BOKEH</h2>
                        <hr /><p>Bokeh of an IMAGE is highly dependent on the lighting of a scene, distance between lens, subject and background, how much contrast is in a background scene, how much the background contributes to an image (maybe you WANT the background to be partially visible), how busy the background is, as well as lens factors, as well.  This website is ONLY meant to address the LENS FACTORS that affect the bokeh of an image rendered by a particular lens, as this is the ONLY part of bokeh that should, at least in theory, be measurable - although many would argue it is not.</p>
